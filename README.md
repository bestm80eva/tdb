Test Data Builder
=================

`tdb` is a tiny [Test Data Builder](http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html) for JavaScript, inspired by 
[Make It Easy](https://github.com/npryce/make-it-easy) and [Factory Girl](http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl).

Use it to create value objects in your tests without the clutter of incidental details.

See tests for examples.
